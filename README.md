# Arduino accelerometer logging code

## Instructions (Arduino IDE)

Move contents of lib folder to the Arduino IDE's library folder.

Open src/Razor_AHRS.pde in Arduino IDE.

This should now compile.

## Instructions (Ino)

[Ino](http://inotool.org/) commands can be run from base directory (e.g. ino build, ino upload).

The ino serial command has a penchant for kernel panics on osx.
